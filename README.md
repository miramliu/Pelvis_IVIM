# Pelvis_IVIM

Included in "Pelvis_IVIM_PIPELINE_09242025" is the pipeline for post-processing IVIM of the female pelvis with given ROIs drawn in MIM. The marker >> represents a line of code in matlab. 

It is step-by-step, for easiest use… may over-explain. 

A video regarding the code step by step is available at https://mtsinai-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/mirabai_liu_mountsinai_org/ET8Poc1-MqBOhNSHEN6MigcBza-GSJ6QM2jWO3RzNEwpfA?e=3vBJLy 

A very basic statistical analysis is available in "Statistical_Analysis_11042025".  

Any questions, please reach out to Mira Liu (mirabai.liu@mountsinai.org)

The code is run in MATLAB R2024b.
