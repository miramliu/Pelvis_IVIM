# Pelvis_IVIM

Included in "Pelvis_IVIM_PIPELINE_09242025.docx" is the pipeline for post-processing IVIM of the female pelvis with given ROIs drawn in MIM. The marker >> represents a line of code in matlab. 

It is step-by-step, for easiest use… may over-explain. 

A video regarding the code step by step is available at https://mtsinai-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/mirabai_liu_mountsinai_org/ET8Poc1-MqBOhNSHEN6MigcBza-GSJ6QM2jWO3RzNEwpfA?e=3vBJLy 

A very basic statistical analysis is available in "Statistical_Analysis_11042025".  

Any questions, please reach out to Mira Liu (mirabai.liu@mountsinai.org)

The code is run in MATLAB R2024b.

## Updated with added T1 VFA with B1 Correction

Included in "Pelvis_T1_PIPELINE_11062025.docx" is the pipeline for getting T1 mapping of the female pelvis with given ROIs drawn in MIM. The marker >> represents a line of code in matlab. 

It is step-by-step, for easiest use… may over-explain. It does not perform post-processing, assuming analysis from the scanner is correct. 

A very basic statistical analysis is available in "Statistical_Analysis_11042025", with slight adjustment for T1. 

Any questions, please reach out to Mira Liu (mirabai.liu@mountsinai.org).

The code is run in MATLAB R2024b.
